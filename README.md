# Project title: Password Generator

## Description

- My motivation on doing this project was to earn a new skill.

- I builded that project to apply what I've learned.

- I created a function. I added a window prompt to ask the user about desired password length between 8 and 128, I created an alert if the user input not a number between 8 and 128. I added a window confirm to ask the user if they want to include uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters, I created another alert if the user did not choose any character set. I set each of the character sets to its content. I created a for loop with all of the character sets on it to randomly generate the password based on the user choices of character sets.

- I learned about event listeners, query selectors, functions, if statements, foor loops, window prompts, alerts and confirms.
